# aws-boto3
This project is a collection of Python scripts and modules that demonstrate how to interact with various AWS services using the Boto3 library. Boto3 is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Software Development Kit (SDK) for Python, which allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3 and Amazon EC2.

The scripts included in this project cover a range of use cases, from basic interactions with S3 to more advanced examples like creating and launching EC2 instances programmatically. The code is well-documented and organized, making it easy for developers to understand and modify for their own use cases.

To get started with this project, you'll need to have Python 3.x installed and have an AWS account with appropriate permissions for the services you want to use. You'll also need to install Boto3 using pip.
