"""
In this example, replace your_bucket_name with the name of your S3 bucket, and replace path/to/old/file.txt and path/to/new/file.txt 
with the path of the original file and the new location where you want to move the file, respectively.

This script uses the boto3.client() method to create an S3 client, and then uses the copy_object() method to copy the file to the 
new location and the delete_object() method to delete the file from the old location. Finally, it prints a message to confirm that the file was moved successfully.
