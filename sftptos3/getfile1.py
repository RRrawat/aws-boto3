#Here's a better way to write Python code that copies a file from SFTP to S3 triggered by an EventBridge batch job:

import paramiko
import boto3
import os

# Set up SFTP connection
hostname = "sftp.example.com"
port = 22
username = "myusername"
password = "mypassword"
remote_path = "/path/to/file.txt"
local_path = "/tmp/file.txt"

transport = paramiko.Transport((hostname, port))
transport.connect(username=username, password=password)

sftp = paramiko.SFTPClient.from_transport(transport)
sftp.get(remote_path, local_path)

# Set up S3 connection
s3 = boto3.resource('s3')
bucket_name = 'mybucket'
key = 'file.txt'
s3_path = os.path.join('s3://', bucket_name, key)

# Upload file to S3
s3.Bucket(bucket_name).upload_file(local_path, key)

# Close connections
sftp.close()
transport.close()

"""
This code uses the paramiko library to set up an SFTP connection to download the file from the remote server. 
It then uses the boto3 library to set up an S3 connection and upload the file to the specified bucket and key.

Note that this code assumes that the EventBridge batch job is triggering this code and passing in any necessary arguments, 
such as the file path and bucket/key information. You may need to modify the code accordingly to handle these inputs.
