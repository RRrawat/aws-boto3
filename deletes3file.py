#Here's a basic Python script using Boto3 to delete a file from an S3 bucket:


import boto3

# Replace the placeholders with your S3 bucket name and the name of the file to delete
bucket_name = "your-bucket-name"
file_name = "file-to-delete.txt"

# Create an S3 client
s3 = boto3.client('s3')

# Delete the file from the S3 bucket
s3.delete_object(Bucket=bucket_name, Key=file_name)

print(f"File {file_name} deleted from S3 bucket {bucket_name}")


"""

Make sure to install the boto3 library using pip before running this script. 
You'll also need to have AWS credentials set up on your system with permissions 
to delete objects in the specified S3 bucket.
